## Overview
GadgetHaven is an e-commerce platform where users can browse, view, and purchase various gadgets and electronic devices. Due to time constraints, the website currently lacks full responsiveness, so it may not display optimally on all screen sizes.

---

## React Fundamentals Used
- **Components**: Each section of the website is broken down into reusable components to ensure scalability and maintainability.
- **Props and State**: Data is passed between components using props, and component states are managed effectively.
- **Conditional Rendering**: Display components conditionally based on state or props.
- **Event Handling**: React events like clicks and form submissions are handled efficiently to enhance interactivity.
- **Data Fetching**: Data for products is either fetched from local storage or state.

## Data Management Strategy
- **Local Storage**: Used to store and persist cart data across page refreshes. This allows users to keep items in their cart even if they navigate away from the page or close the browser.

## Features
1. **Product Browsing**: Users can browse a wide range of products with detailed descriptions and specifications.
2. **Cart Management**: Add, remove, and manage cart items with real-time updates.
3. **Dynamic Search and Filter**: Search products by name, category, or other filters to enhance user experience.
4. **Authentication**: Users can log in to track orders and save cart preferences (optional feature).
5. **Basic Styling**: While the design is functional, it is not fully optimized for responsiveness due to time limitations.
